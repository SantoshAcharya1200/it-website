## Postgres intregation 
We need to install the PostgreSQL database adapter to communicate to the database with Python to install it run the following command in the shell.
```
pip install psycopg2
```
Open your Django projectâ€™s settings.py file (located inside the main project folder) and navigate to the DATABASES setting. By default, Django is configured to use SQLite, but weâ€™ll change that to use PostgreSQL.
Replace the DATABASES setting with the following code:
```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'your_database_name',
        'USER': 'your_database_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_database_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',  # Replace with your PostgreSQL server's address if necessary
        'PORT': '',          # Leave empty to use the default PostgreSQL port (usually 5432)
    }
}
```
Next, apply the initial database migrations to create the necessary tables in the PostgreSQL database. Run the following commands:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
Now run the server:
```
py manage.py runserver
```
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser, and if everything is set up correctly, you should see the Django default landing page.
